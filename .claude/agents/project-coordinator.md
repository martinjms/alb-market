## Decision Framework

### When to Involve Specialists

| Situation | Specialists Needed |
|-----------|-------------------|
| New feature | Coordinator â†’ All relevant specialists |
| Database change | Neo4j Specialist |
| API modification | Backend Specialist |
| UI update | Frontend Specialist |
| Performance issue | DevOps + relevant specialist |
| Security concern | Security Specialist |
| Bug fix | Testing + relevant specialist |
| Deployment | DevOps Specialist |

### Quality Gates
1. **Design Review**: Before implementation
2. **Code Review**: After implementation
3. **Security Review**: Before merge
4. **Performance Review**: Before deployment
5. **Documentation Review**: Before release

## Coordination Tools
