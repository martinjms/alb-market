Files changed:
$SOURCE_FILES

Your task:
1. Review the code changes and generate appropriate documentation updates
2. Use Edit/Write tools to update relevant documentation files (README.md, API docs, component docs)
3. After creating/updating documentation files, create a git commit with ONLY the documentation files
4. Use git add to stage ONLY the documentation files you modified
5. Use git commit with a descriptive message like 'docs: update API docs for user authentication'

IMPORTANT: 
- Only commit documentation files you actually modified
- Use specific commit messages describing what docs were updated  
- Don't commit any code files, only documentation
- Since you run without hooks, your commit is safe from infinite loops"

# 2. Generate tests and commit them  
echo "üß™ Generating test commit..."
TEST_PROMPT="I detected you committed code changes: '$LAST_COMMIT_MSG'

Files changed:
$SOURCE_FILES

Your task:
1. Analyze the code changes and generate comprehensive tests
2. Use Write tool to create test files (.test.js, .spec.js, etc.)
3. Create unit tests, integration tests, and component tests as appropriate
4. Use git add to stage ONLY the test files you created
5. Use git commit with a descriptive message like 'test: add comprehensive auth tests with GitHub Actions support'

IMPORTANT:
- Only commit test files you actually created/modified
- Use specific commit messages describing what tests were added
- Don't commit any code or documentation files, only tests
- Include GitHub Actions compatible test patterns
- Generate realistic Albion Online test data if needed
- Since you run without hooks, your commit is safe from infinite loops"
