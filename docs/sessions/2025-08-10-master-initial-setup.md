## Current State
- Git repository initialized
- Comprehensive claude.md created with all project rules
- Monorepo structure defined for Neo4j + Backend + Frontend
- **✅ Docker development environment fully configured**
- **✅ One-command startup system implemented (`pnpm start`)**
- **✅ Neo4j database running with 3,790 items restored**
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline documented
- Three-phase development approach established
- Memory management system implemented (CLAUDE.md + session files)
- Onboarding script created for human developers
- Enforcement mechanisms documented
- Session files now require continuous updates after every user request/change
- AI agents should automatically follow rules without being told
- **✅ All documentation updated for Docker-based workflow**

## Blockers/Issues
- **PENDING:** Actual technology choices (Express vs Fastify, state management)
- **PENDING:** Business requirements not yet defined
- ✅ **RESOLVED:** Neo4j instance configured and running with Docker

## Decisions Made
- Monorepo structure using PNPM workspaces + Turborepo
- Neo4j as primary database (graph-based)
- Three-phase development: MVP → Production → Scale
- /tmp folder for temporary scripts (gitignored)
- .credentials file for secure credential storage (never edited by agents)
- Session files in /docs/sessions/ for development journaling
- CLAUDE.md for persistent technical memory
- Strict enforcement through automation (pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions)

## Next Steps
1. Define business requirements and features
2. Choose specific technology stack (Express/Fastify, React state management)
3. Set up actual monorepo structure with packages
4. Configure Neo4j database
5. Implement pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions
6. Create initial backend and frontend packages

## Files Modified
- claude.md (created - comprehensive project rules)
- CLAUDE.md (created - persistent memory)
- .gitignore (created)
- /tmp/.gitkeep (created)
- /scripts/onboarding.sh (created)
- /docs/sessions/ (directory structure created)

## Test Commands
```bash
# Once packages are set up:
pnpm test:all
./scripts/onboarding.sh  # For new developers
```

- Created documentation structure and enforcement mechanisms
- Ready to begin feature development once requirements defined

## Notes for Next Session
- Review business requirements before implementing
- Ensure Neo4j is installed and configured
- User ready to describe the application requirements
- User noted GitHub uses 'main' instead of 'master' as default branch name
- Branch successfully renamed to main and pushed to GitHub
- User requested test of subagent access
- Clarified that agent configurations are reference documents, not invokable subagents
- Agents serve as role definitions and expertise guides for focused work
- Discovered agents need proper YAML frontmatter format to be invokable
- Created conversion script to fix all 9 agents to proper Claude Code format
- Session restart required after running conversion script for changes to take effect
- User revealed ALB Market is for Albion Online game
- Need research agent for Albion Online data sources
- Albion Wiki requires r.jina.ai tool for access
- Multiple data sources: wikis, community sources, open APIs
- Created Albion Research Specialist (10th agent)
- User asks about data flow: research → database
- User has existing Neo4j backups from previous attempt
- Decided: Neo4j specialist creates insert scripts, Research agent executes them
- User wants database backups in JSON format for restoration
- User will provide items.txt and items.json with verified item data
- Research agent must NEVER generate IDs/names using patterns
- Workflow: Insert base data → Query incomplete items → Research & update
- Use missing fields (category, icon URL) as completion markers
- All 9 specialist agents configured and ready
- Need to define ALB Market business model and features
- Set up actual package structure based on claude.md specifications
- Implement the automated enforcement mechanisms (hooks, CI)
- Remember to maintain MVP shortcuts initially, clean up in Phase 2
- Session files must be updated continuously during work
- ✅ Docker development environment now fully configured
- ✅ One-command development startup: `pnpm start`
- ✅ Neo4j database restored with 3,790 items automatically
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect Docker-based workflow
- All agents now know to use `pnpm start` for local development

## 2025-08-10 Session Extension: UI Improvements & Context Automation

### UI Dashboard Improvements (PR #20)
- **Context:** User requested visual cleanup of admin dashboard after completing item icon system
- **Changes Made:**
  - Cleaned up ItemIcon.css: Removed visual clutter (borders, shadows, complex hover effects)
  - Simplified hover interactions to subtle scaling only (1.05 scale on hover)
  - Updated AdminDashboard layout: Moved health analysis and random item showcase to top
  - Replaced line chart with pie chart for category distribution (better for categorical data)
  - Changed "Missing Icons" metric to "Missing Categories" (icons are programmatic)
  - Reorganized auto-refresh settings to full-width bottom section

- **Architecture Compliance:**
  - ✅ Followed existing inline styling patterns for dark theme
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with API response formats  
  - ✅ No breaking changes, clean separation of concerns
  - ✅ Enhanced responsive grid layouts
  - ✅ No build artifacts or temporary files committed

### Custom Slash Commands Discovery
- **Context:** User explored slash command customization capabilities
- **Findings:**
  - Slash commands are configurable Markdown files, not built-in system features
  - Project commands: `.claude/commands/` (shared with team)
  - Personal commands: `~/.claude/commands/` (across all projects)
  - Support dynamic arguments, bash execution, file references
  - Can potentially chain or reference other commands (recursion possible)

### Session Context Automation (CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH)
- **Problem:** User had to manually ask for project context at start of each session
- **Solution:** Discovered Claude Code hooks can inject context into conversations
- **Implementation:**
  
  **Files Created:**
  - `.claude/settings.json` - Hook configuration
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "SessionStart": {
        "Bash": ".claude/session-context.sh"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  - `.claude/session-context.sh` - Context extraction script (single source of truth approach)
    - Reads directly from CLAUDE.md (no duplicate JSON to maintain)
    - Extracts project type, status, tech stack, architecture decisions
    - Shows recent commits, GitHub issues, project structure
    - Displays database status and available commands
    - Lists specialized agents available
    
- **Key Design Decision:** Extract from CLAUDE.md rather than maintain separate JSON file
- **Benefits:** 
  - No maintenance overhead (single source of truth)
  - Automatic project context injection on session start
  - Eliminates need for manual "what were we working on" questions
  - Provides recent commits, issues, and current status automatically

### Testing Status
- **Hook Implementation:** Ready for testing in new session
- **Expected Behavior:** Context automatically injected when session starts
- **Fallback:** This session file updated with full context in case hook fails
- **Next Step:** User will restart session to test context injection

### Current Project State
- ✅ 8,000+ Albion Online items validated and in Neo4j database
- ✅ Clean icon display system with programmatic URL generation  
- ✅ Enhanced admin dashboard with intuitive layout
- ✅ Session context automation implemented
- 🔄 Testing automatic context injection via hooks
