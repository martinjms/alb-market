# Session: 2025-08-10 - master (Initial Setup)

## Context
**PR/Issue:** Initial Project Setup
**Started:** 2025-08-10 (Beginning of project)
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-10

## Goals
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create comprehensive project rules (claude.md)
- [x] Set up monorepo structure documentation
- [x] Define Neo4j database conventions
- [x] Establish GitHub workflow with CI/CD
- [x] Create development phases (MVP → Production → Scale)
- [x] Set up temporary scripts folder (/tmp)
- [x] Create secure credentials system (.credentials)
- [x] Implement session files for context preservation
- [x] Create enforcement and compliance system
- [x] Clarify session file continuous update requirement
- [x] Clarify onboarding script usage (AI vs Human)

## Current State
- Git repository initialized
- Comprehensive claude.md created with all project rules
- Monorepo structure defined for Neo4j + Backend + Frontend
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline documented
- Three-phase development approach established
- Memory management system implemented (CLAUDE.md + session files)
- Onboarding script created for human developers
- Enforcement mechanisms documented
- Session files now require continuous updates after every user request/change
- AI agents should automatically follow rules without being told

## Blockers/Issues
- **PENDING:** Actual technology choices (Express vs Fastify, state management)
- **PENDING:** Business requirements not yet defined
- **PENDING:** Neo4j instance not yet configured

## Decisions Made
- Monorepo structure using PNPM workspaces + Turborepo
- Neo4j as primary database (graph-based)
- Three-phase development: MVP → Production → Scale
- /tmp folder for temporary scripts (gitignored)
- .credentials file for secure credential storage (never edited by agents)
- Session files in /docs/sessions/ for development journaling
- CLAUDE.md for persistent technical memory
- Strict enforcement through automation (pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions)

## Next Steps
1. Define business requirements and features
2. Choose specific technology stack (Express/Fastify, React state management)
3. Set up actual monorepo structure with packages
4. Configure Neo4j database
5. Implement pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions
6. Create initial backend and frontend packages

## Files Modified
- claude.md (created - comprehensive project rules)
- CLAUDE.md (created - persistent memory)
- .gitignore (created)
- /tmp/.gitkeep (created)
- /scripts/onboarding.sh (created)
- /docs/sessions/ (directory structure created)

## Test Commands
```bash
# Once packages are set up:
pnpm test:all
./scripts/onboarding.sh  # For new developers
```

## Session Updates Log
- Initial setup and rules creation
- User clarified session files need continuous updates (not every 2 hours)
- User asked about onboarding script usage
- Updated claude.md to reflect continuous session updates
- Clarified AI agents should automatically follow rules without being told
- Onboarding script is for human developers, not AI agents
- User requested specialized subagent configurations
- Created 7 specialized agent configurations:
  - Project Coordinator (orchestration)
  - Neo4j Specialist (graph database)
  - Backend API Specialist (server development)
  - Frontend React Specialist (UI development)
  - DevOps Infrastructure Specialist (deployment)
  - Testing QA Specialist (quality assurance)
  - Security Specialist (security audit)
- Created agent README explaining usage patterns
- Updated claude.md with agent quick reference
- User asked about documentation maintenance rules
- Created Documentation Specialist agent (8th specialist)
- Updated rules to make Documentation Specialist mandatory after every code change
- Documentation now automatically maintained through agent workflow
- Updated all agent configurations to include documentation handoff
- User provided GitHub access token in .credentials file (GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN)
- User requested Product Manager agent for feature design and issue creation
- Created Product Manager agent (9th specialist) for GitHub issue creation
- Created issue templates (feature, bug, task, epic) in /templates/
- Created GitHub CLI setup script in /tmp/setup-github-cli.sh
- Product Manager can now create detailed GitHub issues with acceptance criteria

## Commit Summary
- Initial project setup with comprehensive development rules
- Created 9 specialized AI agents for development workflow
- Established monorepo structure for Neo4j + Backend + Frontend
- Set up GitHub integration and issue templates
- Created documentation structure and enforcement mechanisms
- Ready to begin feature development once requirements defined

## Notes for Next Session
- Review business requirements before implementing
- Ensure Neo4j is installed and configured
- User ready to describe the application requirements
- User noted GitHub uses 'main' instead of 'master' as default branch name
- Branch successfully renamed to main and pushed to GitHub
- User requested test of subagent access
- Clarified that agent configurations are reference documents, not invokable subagents
- Agents serve as role definitions and expertise guides for focused work
- Discovered agents need proper YAML frontmatter format to be invokable
- Created conversion script to fix all 9 agents to proper Claude Code format
- Session restart required after running conversion script for changes to take effect
- User revealed ALB Market is for Albion Online game
- Need research agent for Albion Online data sources
- Albion Wiki requires r.jina.ai tool for access
- Multiple data sources: wikis, community sources, open APIs
- Created Albion Research Specialist (10th agent)
- User asks about data flow: research → database
- User has existing Neo4j backups from previous attempt
- Decided: Neo4j specialist creates insert scripts, Research agent executes them
- User wants database backups in JSON format for restoration
- User will provide items.txt and items.json with verified item data
- Research agent must NEVER generate IDs/names using patterns
- Workflow: Insert base data → Query incomplete items → Research & update
- Use missing fields (category, icon URL) as completion markers
- All 9 specialist agents configured and ready
- Need to define ALB Market business model and features
- Set up actual package structure based on claude.md specifications
- Implement the automated enforcement mechanisms (hooks, CI)
- Remember to maintain MVP shortcuts initially, clean up in Phase 2
- Session files must be updated continuously during work
